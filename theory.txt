SPIDER

ITEMS - Defines what data you want to collect. 
        Like a shopping list—you decide the fields (title, price, stock) before scraping.
        You tell Scrapy "I only care about title and price, nothing else."


MIDDLEWARES -   Intercepts requests and responses. Use it to add proxies, change user-agents, handle retries, 
                or modify responses before your spider sees them.

                Before your request goes out, middleware can swap your IP address so the website doesn't block you. When response comes back,
                middleware can check if you got blocked and retry.

PIPELINES - Processes items after extraction. Clean data, validate it, remove duplicates, save to database. 
            Items flow through pipelines in order based on number (100 runs before 200).

            Your spider extracted price as "£51.77". Pipeline converts it to 51.77 as a number. 
            Then the next pipeline saves it to PostgreSQL.

SETTINGS - Controls everything. Turn features on/off, set speed limits, configure which middlewares and pipelines are active.
           You decide: "Use the proxy middleware, use both pipelines, wait 2 seconds between requests."
